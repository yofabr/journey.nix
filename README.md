# journey.nix

A tiny repo documenting my Nix learning journey.

## What this is
- Personal Nix playground
- Small, practical experiments
- Notes I can reuse later

## Current example
`intro/` is a minimal Go + Nix flake setup.

## Run it
```bash
cd intro
nix run
```

## Why Nix
Nix gives reproducible, declarative environments so projects are easier to run across machines.
